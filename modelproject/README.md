# Modelproject

The objective with our modelprojet is to analyze the market equilibrium outcome in  different standard market form settings considered in economics. We start by considering a market with only one supplier, i.e. a monopoly model. Secondly we consider the market in a duopoly setting with two firms competeting in either quantities(Cournot Competition) or prices(Bertrand Competition). We analyze differences between the market outcome in all the considered cases, whether the market equilibrium is pareto efficient or not, and to what extend the market equilibrium deviates from the social optimum. All the considered models are fairly simple, and we start out by solving the models analytically and then numerically.
