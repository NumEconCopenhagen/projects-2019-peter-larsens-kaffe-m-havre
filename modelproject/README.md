# Model project 
The objective with our model project is to analyze the market equilibrium-outcome in different market settings known from economics. We start by considering a market with only one supplier, i.e. a monopoly model. Second, we consider the market in a duopoly setting with two firms competing in either quantities(Cournot Competition) or prices(Bertrand Competition). We analyze differences between the market outcome in all the cases, whether the market equilibrium is pareto efficient or not, and to what extend the market equilibrium deviates from the social optimum. All the considered models are fairly simple, and we start out by solving the models analytically and then numerically.
