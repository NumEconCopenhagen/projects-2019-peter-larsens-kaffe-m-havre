# Examproject

Exam project 
The project consists of three minor assignments 
1.	Human capital 
We consider a dynamic consumer problem in 2 periods. First, we solve for the cutoff value of human capital in period 2. Second, we solve for the cutoff value of human capital in period 1. Third, we are asked if the agent never works, and we solve this by showing the relative levels of human capital and the unemployment benefit that makes the worker willing to work, even if the unemployment benefit is higher than the wage. 

2.	AS-AD
In the second assignment an AS-AD model is solved. First, the equilibrium for output and inflation is solved. The effects of a demand shock to the economy is then analyzed and we then look at the development of the economy afterward the shock. Afterwards the shocks are changed to be stochastic. The variances, autocorrelations and correlations are calculated, and a numerical optimizer is used to make the simulated statistics as close as possible to the US business cycle data 

3.	Exchange economy
In the third assignment we have an exchange economy where we are asked to find Walras-equilibrium under different assumptions. We are given Cobb-Douglas preferences with log-normally distributed coefficients. Under different distributions of the endowments we calculate different Walras-equilibriums.
